# EHM-Lab Resources

The EHM-Lab has produced a set of openly accessible resources which can be explored in full at [ehm-lab.github.io](https://ehm-lab.github.io).

Resources include datasets, code repositories linked to tutorials and published analyses, R packages and other software tools, and web apps to showcase research outputs. Specifically:

[Code repositories](https://ehm-lab.github.io/rcode.html): a set of repositories stored in the EHM-Labâ€™s GitHub webpage. Each repository includes code (and optionally data) to reproduce (in full or in part) tutorials on specific methodologies or published epidemiological analyses. Links to full-text versions of the publications are included in the repositories.

[Data](https://ehm-lab.github.io/data.html): a series of entire databases produced by the EHM-Lab and made available freely in open-access form. These databases contain input data, results, and synthetic datasets linked to specific publications. They can be used to replicate epidemiological analyses, to showcase and disseminate results, or for further research.

[Web apps](https://ehm-lab.github.io/apps.html): web tools created by the EHM-Lab using R-Shiny and released as interactive apps. They allow users to explore results from epidemiological analyses using maps and tables, and to download selected or entire sets of data.

[R Packages](https://ehm-lab.github.io/pkgs.html): packages for the R software developed by members of the EHM-Lab, released in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Links to the official CRAN webpages and the development versions in related GitHub pages are provided.
