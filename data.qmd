This repository contains the data and results from the paper Estimating future heat-related and cold-related mortality under climate change, demographic and adaptation scenarios in 854 European cities published in Nature Medicine (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03452-2).

Contains data to reconstruct the exposure-response functions (ERF) of temperature-related mortality by five 5 age groups in 854 cities in Europe derived in the study by Masselot et al. 2023, Excess mortality attributed to heat and cold: a health impact assessment study in 854 cities in Europe, The Lancet Planetary Health (https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00023-2).
