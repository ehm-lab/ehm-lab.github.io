Making changes and publishing the ehm-lab.github.io

Hey there, I hope you are here becasue you have made some changes to this repo (which you know produces and serves our lab website to the internet) and now you want the website to be updated accordingly.

Commit-Push the changes to (the main branch). Wait for the auto-render-publish workflow to run (anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes).
If you do not want to rerender the whole site, if you just want to make a change to some file in the repo and not have any effect on the rendered site, add "[skip ci]" to the commit message.

Oh, yeah that's it.
